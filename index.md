### What on Earth does this do? What is it for? How can it help me?

Recently, Microsoft released WSL2. WSL2 is a system that allows Linux programs to be installed on Windows 10. Unfortunately, there is a downside: WSL2 does not natively support graphical apps. GWSL2 bridges this gap. It is an extremely customizable XServer that integrates with Windows 10. 

With GWSL, you can simply run graphical linux apps on windows.
