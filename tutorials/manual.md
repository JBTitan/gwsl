## GWSL Manual

### Prerequisites ###

GWSL requires [Windows 10 version 2004](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028685/windows-10-get-the-update). If you do not have it, please update Windows to continue.

Once Windows is up to date, be sure you have the WSL feature installed and configured properly. Here are some helpful links:
*  [Familiarizing Yourself With WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
*  [Enabling WSL and Installing Distros](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

To make sure WSL is installed correctly, type ```wsl.exe``` in the command line and verify that there are no errors.

### Installing GWSL ###

GWSL can be easily installed from the Microsoft Store. If it is not already installed, get it [here](ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9NL6KD1H33V3) or [here](	https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NL6KD1H33V3).

### The GWSL User Interface ###
#### The Dashboard 

You can open the GWSL Dashboard by clicking the GWSL icon in the Start Menu. Once GWSL is running, you can quickly pull up the Dashboard with ```CTRL+ALT+G``` or by clicking the "G" icon in the notification area.

Overview: The GWSL Dashboard is where you can configure WSL machines, create shortcuts, and quickly launch apps.
