# NOTE: GWSL on the Microsoft Store is currently broken. In the meantime, please use the [traditional Windows installer](https://opticos.github.io/gwsl/tutorials/download.html). An update fixing this issue will soon roll out on the store but I don't know when. If you move from the Store version of GWSL to the traditional version or vice versa, shortcuts will need to be recreated.
